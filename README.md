### RAWD Application
<div align="justify"> 
This repository develops a novel MATLAB® Toolbox application, entitled Release Allocation and Weir Design (RAWD), using MATLAB® App Designer, in which optimal outlets are designed for four types of outlets, including an orifice, a proportional, a rectangular, or a triangular weir located downstream of a dam reservoir for multiple flood hydrograph scenarios handling uncertainties in flood conditions by the conditional value-at-risk (CvaR) and nonlinear interval number programming (NINP) techniques, while, satisfying the downstream water demands. The utilized optimization framework in this application is developed using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm- II (NSGA-II) based on the CvaR and NINP risk assessment approaches applying to the outflow discharges loss from an acceptable limit using the probable maximum flood (PMF)  approach for allowable flood discharges specifications. In this application, the user can obtain the optimal earlier mentioned outlets designs using one of the sixteen numerical methods from a conventional decisive numerical technique, the so-called Runge-Kutta method, to solve the governing reservoir routing ordinary differential equation (ODE)s.
