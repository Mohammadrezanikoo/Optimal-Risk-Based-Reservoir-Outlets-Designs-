### RAWD Application
<div align="justify"> 
This repository develops a novel MATLAB® Toolbox application, entitled Release Allocation and Weir Design (RAWD), using MATLAB® App Designer, in which optimal outlets are designed for four types of outlets, including an orifice, a proportional, a rectangular, or a triangular weir located downstream of a dam reservoir for multiple flood hydrograph scenarios handling uncertainties in flood conditions by the conditional value-at-risk (CvaR) and nonlinear interval number programming (NINP) techniques, while, satisfying the downstream water demands.
